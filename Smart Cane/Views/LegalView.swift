There is no intention to replace the use of the orginal cane. The user must understand that the Smart cane is simply a cane with add abilities. Any misuse of the cane is the responsibility of the user and they will be help accountable. Under no circumstances should the user attempt to open the Smaer Cane, doing so may cause the Smart Cane to break and again is the responsibility of the user should any incidents occur. Hazards do exist should the Smart Cane unintentionally break, These hazards include but are not limited to: loose live electrical wireing, faulty sensors, faulty camera vision, incorrect location reading, battery failure, and improper distance measurments. Should an event occur when one of the functionallities of the cane fail with or without the Smart Cane being tampered with by the user, it will remain the users responsibility should an incident occur. This is because the Smart cane does not replace the orginal cane and should be used with equal caution as the normal cane.")
